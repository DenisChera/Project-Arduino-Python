# Description

This project uses two ultrasonic sensors connected to an Arduino to detect hand movements and control media functions on a PC. The right sensor manages scrolling and volume, while the left sensor handles play/pause and file navigation. The Arduino sends commands via serial to a Python script, which interprets them and triggers keyboard and mouse actions using pyautogui. It enables intuitive, contactless gesture-based media control.
